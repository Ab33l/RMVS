Business advisory services will also be offered to struggling but potentially profitable businesses including distressed issuers of securities to the public,” KDC director general Christopher Huka said.\r\n\r\nThe regulator has been facing the problem of how to revive failing market players and put on hold plans to put listed companies on a recovery board pending delisting over balance sheet deterioration due to the Covid-19 pandemic.\r\n\r\nCMA chief executive Wyckliffe Shamiah said the board has approved the criteria of listing companies in the recovery board and all other procedures but the regulator has been reluctant to begin implementing the programme on consideration that many companies were hit during the pandemic.\r\n\r\nInitially, the regulator wanted struggling firms placed under the recovery board and given three years to get compliant if they become insolvent as the market seeks to end a run of failed firms at the NSE.\r\n\r\nWithin the three years, the firms will be put under a microscope and report on a quarterly basis to the NSE and CMA or get delisted if they fail this prescribed regimen.\r\n\r\nFirms that breach listing rules have to come up with a plan within six months or get ejected.\r\n\r\nLater CMA reviewed the eligibility criteria for companies that are technically insolvent, under receivership and statutory administrations, companies facing corporate governance and management issues and high-risk companies.\r\n\r\nFirms with working capital challenges, which are considered ‘short term’ have been granted a helping hand under the reviewed eligibility criteria as they will not be put on a recovery board.', 'https://www.businessdailyafrica.com/resource/image/3700940/landscape_ratio16x9/1160/652/dd305ab059b2c252de7c17ae2f4797ff/XQ/nse.jpg', 'Michael Thomas', '2', '2022-09-28 11:03:08', '2022-09-28 11:03:08'),
(2, 6, 'CBK under pressure from the rich to raise borrowing rates', 'Wealthy investors and financiers like banks and pension schemes are putting pressure on the Central Bank of Kenya (CBK) to increase the cost of government borrowing as global hikes in lending rates make local assets less attractive.\r\n\r\nInvestors are unwilling to lend the government billions of shillings in a push for higher interest rates, signalling a funding headache that awaits the new administration.\r\n\r\nBut the CBK has resisted efforts to push bond rates above the 14 percent mark, which will reward investors while making it costly for the Treasury to borrow amid risks of commercial bank lending rates could spike.\r\n\r\nALSO READ: Treasury misses target again in latest bond sale\r\n\r\nSince July this year, the CBK has borrowed Sh93.2 billion in bonds, which is 58.2 percent of the Sh160 billion sought by the government.\r\n\r\nThe CBK may have to accept higher-priced bids if it is to improve the performance rate of bond issuances going forward, analysts warn.\r\n\r\n“Expectations of higher inflation coupled with the sovereign’s preference for local deficit financing continues to boost interest rate projections,” NCBA Group said in an economic update.\r\n\r\n“The CBK has, however, remained keen on rejecting expensive bids in an effort to contain the upward adjustment in yields as well as anchor the government’s cost of borrowing.”\r\n\r\nThe CBK faces the challenge of keeping borrowing costs manageable for the new administration amid the reluctance to access foreign commercial loans due to their surging costs.\r\n\r\nThe Treasury recently abandoned plans to float at least $1 billion (Sh120 billion) Eurobond after interest demanded by investors doubled to about 12 percent from 6.3 percent a year earlier for a similar amount.\r\n\r\nKenya has in the past three financial years largely tapped cheaper concessional loans, helping slow down the accumulation of expensive short-term foreign commercial credit and loans from rich countries which largely come on semi-concessional terms.\r\n\r\nThe rise in global borrowing costs is highly unwelcome to developing countries, many of which are struggling to return to pre-pandemic economic output levels.\r\n\r\nThe costly borrowing costs are tied to the decision by a host of central banks from across the world to raise interest rates in a global fight against inflation that is sending shockwaves across financial markets and economies.\r\n\r\nThe US Federal Reserve set the pace on Wednesday with a 0.75 percent rate hike, its fifth since March, and a half dozen central banks from Indonesia to Norway followed suit with rises of similar or identical size within hours.\r\n\r\nLow returns in the Kenyan market means investors are seeking better returns in foreign markets that have recently become more attractive as global rates increase.\r\n\r\nInvestors have demanded over 14 percent for three long-dated bonds, but the CBK only accepted 13.9 percent on a 15-year bond, 13.9 percent on a 20-year bond and 13.8 percent on another 15-year bond.\r\n\r\nSince the beginning of the fiscal year on July 1, the Treasury has floated four bonds in nine tranches, most of which have fallen significantly short of raising their target amounts.\r\n\r\nThis has led the CBK, which acts as the government fiscal agent, to reject bids worth Sh66.8 billion since July.\r\n\r\nThis may impact the government’s target of raising Sh565 billion from the domestic market to plug the Sh845 billion hole in the national budget for the year ending June 2023.\r\n\r\nThe rate hikes also tend to spark dollar outflows to safe havens in the developed world that ultimately depress the value of the local currency.\r\n\r\nIn Kenya, the shilling has weakened 6.1 percent to 120.1 units against the dollar since the start of the year, compared to a 0.5 percent depreciation in a similar period in 2021.\r\n\r\nGenghis Capital Economist George Bodo says an investor will need outsized returns on Kenyan currency-denominated assets to compete with the rates offered in the developed markets.\r\n\r\n\"To achieve stickiness in capital flows and counterbalance rate rises in the US and Europe, emerging markets must now premiumise returns on domestic assets,\" Mr Bodo said.\r\n\r\nExpensive borrowing will hurt President William Ruto administration’s that is battling the effects of the soaring public debt.\r\n\r\nBesides debt, Dr Ruto will also have to steer a pandemic-battered economy, rising food and fuel prices spurred by the war in Ukraine, and the worst drought in four decades.\r\n\r\nThe new President in his maiden United Nation’s address signalled his preference for debt restructuring that had been proposed by his Azimio coalition rivals when he asked the multilateral lenders and Paris Club of rich countries to reschedule developing world debt.\r\n\r\n\"The World Bank, the IMF and other lenders must extend pandemic-related debt relief to the worst-hit countries, especially those affected by the devastating combination of conflict, climate change and Covid-19,\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"The G20 must also suspend or reschedule debt repayments by middle-income countries during the pandemic recovery period.\"',

(3, 10, 'Fintech in Africa: The end of the beginning ', 'Between 2020 and 2021, the number of tech start-ups in Africa tripled to around 5,200 companies. Just under half of these are fintechs, which are making it their business to disrupt and augment traditional financial services. 1 Absa analysis shows that African fintechs have already made significant inroads into the market, with estimated revenues of around $4 billion to $6 billion in 2020 and average penetration levels of between 3 and 5 percent (excluding South Africa). These figures are in line with global market leaders.\r\n\r\nOne industry leader we spoke with said that rather than a “fintech disruption,” the continent is experiencing a “fintech eruption,” and local and international investors are taking notice. African fintech is emerging as a hotbed for investment, with average deal sizes growing and the proportion of fintech funding in Africa increasing over the past year, bringing jobs and growth to African economies. And the story is only just beginning. As fintech matures, financial services on the continent are at an inflection point, and several African countries have a significant opportunity to capitalize on the momentum of recent years to unlock further potential in the sector.\r\n\r\nDespite a slow down in funding in line with global trends, we expect significant growth and value creation to lie ahead for the fintech industry in Africa. Cash is still used in around 90 percent of transactions in Africa, which means that fintech revenues have huge potential to grow. If the sector overall can reach similar levels of penetration to those seen in Kenya, a country with one of the highest levels of fintech penetration in the world, we estimate that African fintech revenues could reach eight times their current value by 2025.\r\n\r\nAbsa analysis estimates that Africa’s financial-services market could grow at about 10 percent per annum, reaching about $230 billion in revenues by 2025 ($150 billion excluding South Africa, which is the largest and most mature market on the continent) (Exhibit 2). Nimble fintech players have wasted no time carving out a share of this expanding market. As the fastest-growing start-up industry in Africa, the success of fintech companies is being fueled by several trends, including increasing smartphone ownership, declining internet costs, and expanded network coverage, as well as a young, fast-growing, and rapidly urbanizing population. 4 The COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated existing trends toward digitalization and created a fertile environment for new technology players, even as it caused significant hardship and disrupted lives and livelihoods across the continent.', 'https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/industries/financial%20services/our%20insights/fintech%20in%20africa%20the%20end%20of%20the%20beginning/fintech-in-africa-the-end-of-the-beginning-hero-1536x864.jpg?mw=1536&car=72:35&cq=50', 'David Hendrickson', '1', '2022-09-30 09:18:16', '2022-09-30 09:18:16'),

John Paulson, who became a billionaire after shorting mortgage securities before the global financial crisis, sees another housing downturn coming. Meanwhile, a research firm now sees a 98% chance of a global recession and a JPMorgan trading model shows 92% odds. Who wants to be saddled with mortgage payments if the economy bottoms out? \r\n\r\nStocks offer little solace. Earlier this week, the S&P 500 sank to the lowest level since November 2020. The Nasdaq 100 is down about 30% so far this year, which has wiped away trillions of dollars in market value. There are lots of reasons for the slump. Investors are reassessing the post-pandemic value of many business models. Interest-rate hikes are diminishing the value of companies’ future earnings. Meanwhile, inflation is driving up costs and a stronger dollar is weighing on profits. \r\n\r\nSpeaking of currencies, this was quite a week. The Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index has surged about 15% this year, and reached a record high Tuesday. It was a very different story with the pound, which tumbled to a record low of $1.0350 Monday. Some strategists bet it will fall below $1. Currencies are an incredibly tough asset for retail investors to crack; few financial advisers would recommend dabbling solo. Yet I took a walk around London, where I live, and found that some American students here have become accidental currency traders. \r\n\r\nWhere to from here? Investment banks keep putting out similar research: Cash is back. Goldman Sachs strategists say they are staying overweight cash. BlackRock is advising investors to “shun most stocks.” Analysts at Bank of America see cash, commodities and bets on volatility outperforming bonds and stocks. Good to know, but I still urge you: Please don’t do anything drastic. My colleague explains why in this helpful article about resisting the temptation to jump in and out of markets when everything is falling.

(9, 10, 'South Africa claims top position in the Absa Africa Financial Markets Index', 'South Africa has for the third year running, claimed top position among 20 African countries ranked by the Absa Africa Financial Markets Index in terms of financial markets development. This is mainly because of its sizeable lead in market depth and deep market liquidity supported by strong domestic investors. \r\n\r\nThe country was also ranked top in access to foreign exchange, market transparency, tax and regulatory environment and capacity of local investors. It however came second to Egypt on macro-economic opportunity and third on legality and enforceability of standard financial markets master agreements after Mauritius and Kenya, respectively. \r\n\r\nThe index, now in its third year, assesses progress and potential across six key pillars and was produced by the Official Monetary and Financial Institutions Forum (OMFIF), an independent research think tank for central banking, economic policy and public investment.\r\n\r\nThe countries were ranked based on the following pillars:\r\n\r\nPillar 1 \r\nMarket Depth: Examines size, liquidity and diversity of products in markets, as well as countries’ efforts to merge exchanges and launch new markets.\r\n\r\nPillar 2\r\nAccess to foreign exchange:  Looks at factors that impact markets’ accessibility to international investors, including the severity of capital controls, exchange rate reporting standards and levels of foreign exchange liquidity.\r\n\r\nPillar 3\r\nMarket transparency, tax and regulatory environment: Assesses countries’ regulatory and tax environments for financial markets, as well as transparency and enforcement of accounting rules.\r\n\r\nPillar 4\r\nCapacity of local investors: Examines the size of local investors, assessing the level of local demand against supply of assets available in each market.\r\n\r\nPillar 5\r\nMacro-economic opportunity: Evaluates economic performance, financial risks and financial transparency, demonstrated by availability of data, open monetary policy communication and the timely release of state budgets.\r\n\r\nPillar 6\r\nLegality and enforceability of standard financial markets master agreements: Measures how well countries have adopted internationally accepted legal standards, the enforcement of netting and collateral positions, and insolvency regime adequacy.\r\n\r\nThe head of global markets for Absa regional operations, George Asante says South Africa’s top ranking across four pillars is not surprising given the development and sophistication of its financial markets. However, other countries ranked in the index are fast catching up due to ongoing regulatory and policy reforms in those markets, which Asante partly attributes to the impact the index is having. \r\n\r\n“South Africa tops the index largely due to its sizeable lead in market depth. While it is likely to remain an outlier in this pillar, the creation of new bourses and key mergers between existing ones will improve the standing of other countries in coming years,” Asante says.\r\n\r\nSouth Africa’s high position on access to foreign exchange after having been overtaken by Kenya in the previous edition of this index was as a result of high interbank foreign exchange turnover, regular exchange rate reporting and a favourable reserve level relative to net portfolio flows. \r\n\r\nIn the market transparency, tax and regulatory environment pillar, South Africa’s scored highest on its tax environment for financial markets which plays a crucial role in offering investors incentives to invest in financial products. “They provide transparency, which is vital for fostering investor confidence,” Asante says.\r\n\r\nSouth Africa beat other countries on the fourth pillar of capacity of local investors because of its deep and liquid capital markets which offer local pension funds many investment options.  “Its pension funds are also large relative to the capitalisation of assets listed on the Johannesburg stock market, which means they contribute to its liquidity and development, as well as benefitting from it,” Asante says.\r\n\r\nCommenting on the overall findings, Asante says the impact of the index is demonstrated by the progress financial regulatory authorities are making to further reform their financial markets across African markets. \r\n\r\n“There has been a concerted effort among African policy-makers to react to the findings. This can be seen in the vast improvements in Pillar 6, ‘legality and enforceability of standard financial markets master agreements’, where countries have responded to past findings in order to align with best practice. The index is therefore becoming a powerful barometer for policy-makers and playing a role in building an Africa which is able to fund itself,” he says. \r\n\r\nPeter Matlare, Deputy Chief Executive Officer, Absa Group, meanwhile says the deepening and widening of financial markets are crucial steps towards national economic self-sufficiency in Africa.\r\n\r\n“To reach the next level of growth, Africa requires a collective commitment to ensuring the transnational cross-pollination of ideas. This index suggests we are making headway. The continent’s challenges are clearly visible and its countries are crafting actionable solutions,” Matlare says.\r\n\r\nHe says Absa is committed to furthering the development and prosperity of the continent and its people.

', 'Net worth has tripled since 2000, but the increase mainly reflects valuation gains in real assets, especially real estate, rather than investment in productive assets that drive our economies. \r\n\r\nWe have borrowed a page from the corporate world—namely, the balance sheet—to take stock of the underlying health and resilience of the global economy as it begins to rebound from the COVID-19 pandemic. This view from the balance sheet complements more typical approaches based on GDP, capital investment levels, and other measures of economic flows that reflect changes in economic value. Our report, The rise of the global balance sheet: How productively are we using our wealth?, provides an in-depth look at the global economy after two decades of financial turbulence and more than ten years of heavy central bank intervention, punctuated by the pandemic.\r\n\r\nAcross ten countries that account for about 60 percent of global GDP—Australia, Canada, China, France, Germany, Japan, Mexico, Sweden, the United Kingdom, and the United States—the historic link between the growth of net worth and the growth of GDP no longer holds. While economic growth has been tepid over the past two decades in advanced economies, balance sheets and net worth that have long tracked it have tripled in size. This divergence emerged as asset prices rose—but not as a result of 21st-century trends like the growing digitization of the economy.\r\n\r\nRather, in an economy increasingly propelled by intangible assets like software and other intellectual property, a glut of savings has struggled to find investments offering sufficient economic returns and lasting value to investors. These savings have found their way instead into real estate, which in 2020 accounted for two-thirds of net worth. Other fixed assets that can drive economic growth made up only about 20 percent the total. Moreover, asset values are now nearly 50 percent higher than the long-run average relative to income.

Explore the findings from our most recent report and scroll for past years’ reports. \r\n\r\nPrivate markets rally to new heights. After a year of pandemic-driven turbulence that suppressed fundraising and deal activity, private markets rebounded across the board. Fundraising was up by nearly 20 percent year over year to reach a record of almost $1.2 trillion (Exhibit 1); dealmakers were busier than ever, deploying $3.5 trillion across asset classes; and assets under management (AUM) grew to an all-time high of $9.8 trillion as of July, up from $7.4 trillion the year before.\r\n\r\nA new set of risks emerged at the beginning of 2022 with the potential to undermine growth and performance. The Russian government’s invasion of Ukraine, higher inflation and interest rates, and supply chain and labor challenges are already increasing volatility three months into the new year.\r\n\r\nPrivate equity continued to drive global growth in private markets. Fundraising rebounded across regions, and global totals fell just short of the prepandemic peak established in 2019. AUM reached an all-time high of $6.3 trillion, driven primarily by asset appreciation within portfolios. With a pooled IRR of 27 percent in 2021, private equity (PE) was once again the highest-performing private markets asset class.\r\n\r\n‘Risk on’ in real estate. Within real estate, investors rotated to higher risk-return strategies relative to their prepandemic preferences, which perhaps reflects investors anticipating buying opportunities in a stressed or distressed environment. Fundraising in opportunistic and value-add strategies grew sharply, while open-end core and core-plus funds experienced net outflows. Investor concerns about rising inflation may prove to be a tailwind for the asset class, given its inflation-hedging properties. \r\n\r\nPrivate debt is an asset class for all seasons. Fundraising growth continued in private debt, the only private asset class to grow fundraising every year since 2011, including through the pandemic. This cyclical resilience is partially driven by the diversity of private debt sub-strategies: when one zigs, another usually zags. Over the longer term, growth has been driven by a dramatic expansion in direct lending strategies, which have accounted for 73 percent of fundraising growth in the last decade.\r\n\r\nInfrastructure—more than roads and bridges. In 2021, infrastructure and natural resources set all-time highs for fundraising, AUM, and deal volume; indeed, global AUM broke the $1 trillion mark for the first time. Over the past decade, infrastructure’s mandate has evolved. Capital is increasingly flowing into subsectors that support the energy transition and digitization, such as alternative energy, clean-tech solutions focused on improving environmental sustainability, and “infratech.” Investors are also looking beyond physical assets at operating companies and technologies to generate value.\r\n\r\nThe sustainability transition presents opportunities and risks—both substantial. GPs and LPs continued to formalize environmental, social, and governance (ESG) commitments in 2021: over half of total fundraising—the highest percentage ever—flowed to firms with formal policies. Investors have become particularly focused on environmental sustainability, a potential win–win for private markets investors who support positive impact while driving returns. Firms can create value by transforming unsustainable business models into green ones and investing in companies scaling decarbonization technologies. Considering climate risk in underwriting is now an imperative; firms that do not run the risk of mispricing their investments.\r\n\r\nPrivate markets firms are making progress on diversity, but work remains. US PE firms have increased the percentage of ethnically diverse talent and women holding junior-level roles, and have made strides in female promotion and retention. However, ethnic diversity is not yet broad-based, and diversity in general is lacking in the most senior roles, suggesting that firms continue to miss opportunities.\r\n\r\nKey lessons emerge as firms accelerate investment in digital and analytics. Leading firms continue to make major investments in digital and analytics capabilities across both front and back office to capture economies of scale as they grow.

Under this proposition, the bank committed to processing SME loans of up to Kes 3 million within 48 hours, from application to having the money in your account.\r\n\r\n“As an organisation, our purpose is to bring possibilities to life, and we do this by connecting peoples’ dreams and aspirations to the financial resources and services they need to accomplish them. As such, we are committed to continue actively contributing to the development of women-owned enterprises because they play a significant in driving economic growth and creating jobs,” Mr Awori said.  \r\n\r\nAccording to ITC, women-led SMEs represent 20 percent of the businesses involved in international trade. Through the SheTrades initiative, ITC is planning to bring more than 3 million women led businesses to market by 2021.\r\n\r\nIn Kenya, the SheTradesKE programme aims to empower more than 10,000 women in the SME sector with the skills and resources they need to effectively compete on the global stage. So far, more than 3 500 Kenyan women have benefitted from the programme through mentorship, training and capacity building conducted via Webinar, face to face interactions and workshops.\r\n\r\nMr Awori said that the SheTradesKE programme aligns well with the bank’s overall commitment to continue offering relevant financial solutions to SMEs under the Ansa brand.\r\n\r\n“We have revamped our SME Wezesha Biashara to provide unsecured loans of up to KES10m with a repayment tenor of up to 6 years; LPO financing; invoice discounting of up to KES50 million and up to KES10 million in unsecured bid bonds with a turnaround time of up to 2 hours. These propositions are designed taking into considerations the challenges facing women entrepreneurs and will go a long way in facilitating their trade,” Mr Awori said.\r\n\r\n“In addition, we offer advisory services as well as networking and international benchmarking opportunities through our Absa Business Club.”', 'https://www.businessdailyafrica.com/resource/image/3703334/landscape_ratio16x9/1160/652/108d80bd7b9c3c2ea32a74dcbf089bc7/vl/app.jpg', 'Urdak Urdra', '6', '2022-10-01 12:14:36', '2022-10-01 12:14:36'),

Normalised performance excludes an exceptional cost of Kes3.2 billion which went towards the recently concluded brand transition to Absa and restructuring programmes.\r\n\r\nThe bank’s performance was significantly impacted by a two-fold growth in impairment as customers struggled to keep up with loan repayments due to the economic effects of Covid-19 and pro-active provisioning for uncertain future.  In line with this, the management took a decisive action to increase provisions in order to best position for future potential credit losses.\r\n\r\nDuring this period, the bank offered loan relief and restructures totalling to over Kes62 billion to customers, equivalent to 30% of its loan portfolio. We also contributed over Kes50 million to the COVID-19 Fund, some of which facilitated provision of 210,000 personal protective equipment (PPEs) to frontline health workers in public hospitals and an additional 20,000 reusable masks to bodaboda riders and others at-risk. A further Kes13 million was invested through colleague-led initiatives in the fight against the pandemic. In order to alleviate the psychological challenges that those who were directly or indirectly affected, we partnered with our wellness partner Minet Kenya, to provide the necessary psychosocial support.\r\n\r\nSpeaking during the release of the bank’s full year results, Absa Kenya Managing Director Jeremy Awori noted that governments, businesses, societies and individuals continue to grapple with one of the most difficult challenges of our time. One whose full impact is yet to be understood and therefore, as management, we took the decision to increase credit impairment provisions by two-fold to position ourselves for the future. “2020 was a tough year and as is expected, the hardships of the banking sector have continued to follow those of the customers and the broader economy. As a result, many sectors have slowed down and peoples’ livelihoods have been greatly disrupted,” said Mr. Awori.\r\n\r\n“The evolving impact of the pandemic has required us to re-visit our strategic priorities and it is clear that greater priority must be given to capital and liquidity preservation. Our focus in the last year has been to help our customers manage through the pandemic and we cushioned them through various interventions such as loan moratoriums and restructures, fee waivers for digital transactions, capacity building for SMEs and other Force for Good initiatives,” Mr. Awori added.\r\n\r\nDespite the raging effects of the pandemic, all business units remained profitable and resilient, registering growth on key lines, with Business Banking and Global Markets divisions revenue growing in double digits.\r\n\r\nTotal income grew by 2% to Kes34.5 billion mainly driven by the growth of non-interest income, which was up 5% year on year. Normalised costs were well maintained, dropping by 4% year on year. Net customer loans went up 7% to close at Kshs.209 billion driven by key focus products namely; general lending, trade loans, mortgage and scheme loans which recorded strong growth year on year.\r\n\r\nInterest income grew by 1% from the prior year largely because of growth in the lending book; though partially offset by margin compression as a result of drops in Central Bank Rate (CBR), whose benefits the bank passed to customers as a responsible lender.\r\n\r\nCustomer deposits grew by 7% to Kes254 billion with transactional accounts making up to 69% of the total deposits.\r\n\r\nOther Highlights include:\r\n\r\nNormalised costs\r\nThe bank’s costs were well managed at Kes16.6 billion reflecting a 4% reduction year on year largely attributed to cost saving initiatives which included automation of processes and continued migration of customer transactions to digital channels. The savings derived were used to fund sustainable investments especially in automation and digitisation to support our customer obsession agenda.\r\n\r\nUpdate on the transition to Absa\r\nOur transition to Absa was successfully completed on time and on budget, having migrated all our technology systems and rebranded all business assets to Absa. The bank will continue upgrading to more advanced systems which will ultimately help enhance the service experience.\r\n\r\nNormalised financials\r\nTo ensure that the financial performance is comparable and to report the progress on the underlying business, Kes3.2 billion has been reported as an exceptional item relating to the cost incurred in the transition project and the recently concluded restructuring programme. This amount was invested in enhancement of technology systems, rebranding as well as marketing and communication efforts to engage various stakeholders.\r\n\r\nAdjusting this number, the normalised profit after tax is Kes6.5 billion; a 23% drop from the previous year. The bank will use the normalised profit in making its decision and therefore exclude the impact of the one-off costs.\r\n\r\nImpairment\r\nImpairment increased by two-fold compared to a similar period reflecting forecast deterioration in macro-economic variables and a few client names. The bank has applied a prudent approach in provisioning for the COVID-19 impact on our customers by taking up an additional Kes5 billion impairment. Most of this impairment is for our performing loans which means that we have cushioned ourselves for the future. If the economy improves, releases of some of the provisions will benefit our future profits. The bank’s average loan loss ratio increased to 4.3% (2.2% in December 2019).\r\n\r\nCapital & Liquidity\r\nAbsa Bank Kenya Plc capital and liquidity ratios remain strong with sufficient headroom above the regulatory requirement. The bank capital adequacy ratio is at 17.5% and liquidity reserve position at 38.7% against the regulatory limits of 14.5% and 20% respectively.\r\n\r\nOutlook\r\nThe level of uncertainty relating to the COVID-19 pandemic remains high and unprecedented, and its impact on markets and the global economy is already profound. We recognise that 2021 presents a positive outlook especially with the on-going vaccination against the virus. However, the economy is still reeling from the effect of COVID19 and it’s yet to recover fully. We anticipate write-backs of provisions we made as the economy recovers.\r\n\r\nOur capital and liquidity levels are solid to navigate the coming quarters and we are seeing opportunities for growth in our balance sheet with recovery in revenue growth and profits expected in 2021.\r\n\r\nThe bank will continue with its key agenda of digital transformation in order to grow and improve our customer experience.', 'https://www.absabank.co.ke/content/dam/kenya/absa/hero-images/About-3360x1218.jpg.rendition.1920.1920.jpg', 'Brian Javlin', '0', '2022-10-01 12:32:27', '2022-10-01 12:32:27'),
(17, 10, 'Absa Bank Kenya marks one-year anniversary', '\r\n\r\nAbsa Bank Kenya Plc. today celebrated its one-year anniversary in the Kenyan market with a commitment to significantly invest towards transforming customer experience.\r\n\r\nThe bank announced that it plans to invest over Kes1.6 billion in technology to enhance service delivery.  Speaking at a media briefing at the bank’s Queensway branch in Nairobi, Absa Managing Director Jeremy Awori noted that delivering a differentiated customer experience remains at the core of the bank’s Growth, Transformation and Returns strategy. “In the next year, we will be rolling out over 60 different technology projects, all aimed at transforming our customer experience. Some of these include automation of our loan top up process, a first-in-the market move which will enable our customers apply and get top ups on their existing loans within 15 minutes, and at the touch of a button. We will also be rolling out a fully-fledged online Business Banking platform in the coming weeks among other exciting innovations across our business segments,” said Mr. Awori.  \r\n\r\nThe bank embarked on a brand transition four years ago and set out to fully transform the business into a truly customer-obsessed organisation; one that puts the customer at the centre of all decisions, propositions and initiatives. In order to get it right, the financial services provider engaged customers across its different segments to better understand, not just their needs but also tastes and preferences further making commitments to fulfill these needs.\r\n\r\n“In many ways, Covid-19 really challenged us to live up to our commitments to all our stakeholders. The pandemic has taught businesses across the world that we must really be prepared to live and operate in a Volatile, Uncertain, Complex and Ambiguous environment, and be agile enough to quickly adapt to changing realities. Today, I can say confidently that we lived up to our commitments to our various stakeholders”, said Mr. Awori.  \r\n\r\nLast year, the bank instituted different financial relief initiatives across its different customer segments to help customers navigate through the effects of the pandemic. This initiatives included loan relief and restructures valued at over Kes62 billion which is equivalent to a third of the lender’s credit portfolio, covering over 59,000 accounts. For SME customers, the bank offered specific capacity building programmes to equip them with the necessary skills to overcome the challenges presented by the pandemic. By proactively managing its business continuity processes, a 100% of the bank’s branches remained open and fully operational while digital platforms had a 99.8% uptime, even with numerous scheduled system upgrades.\r\n\r\nDespite the challenges in the macro-economic environment as a result of the pandemic, the bank continued to lend to various customers with a sizeable portion of this amount going to SME business. An additional Kes50 million was committed to various force for good community based initiatives in support of the fight against the pandemic.\r\n\r\nAgainst all odds, Absa grew its business by introducing new propositions in its product portfolio. The bank introduced the first-in-market Absa vertical debit and credit cards as well as revamped its SME Wezesha Biashara proposition to play a bigger role in the SME sector. This proposition offers unsecured loans of up to Kes10 million which is the highest in the market, as well as LPO financing and invoice discounting of up to Kes50 million amongst other benefits.\r\n\r\n“As we celebrate our one-year anniversary, we recognize that the pandemic continues to threaten the survival of small and medium businesses which are major sources of employment and account for about 40% of our Gross Domestic Product (GDP). As a business we are committed to supporting women in business particularly those in the SME sector, with a campaign that we hope to run across the entire Sub Saharan Africa,” Mr. Awori said.\r\n\r\nThe bank also introduced a new account dubbed Absa One, an all-in-one account with no minimum balance requirement and no monthly fees. This account also offers unsecured loans of up to Kes6 million for individuals, Kes10 million for businesses, 0.5% cashback rewards on all ATM and debit card transactions and a multicurrency prepaid card with up to 8 major currencies.\r\n\r\nOn his part, Absa Chairman Charles Muchene thanked customers, stakeholders, employees and the public for walking with Absa through the rebranding journey, posting an optimistic outlook for the coming year. “I am optimistic about the future, our business is well capitalised and I am confident that we are well positioned to surmount the challenges presented by the pandemic. We have been through many economic cycles in our 104 -year history and we are positive about an improved performance this year,” said Muchene.', 'https://www.absabank.co.ke/content/dam/kenya/absa/hero-images/internetbanking-help-absa-desktop-hero.jpg.rendition.1920.1920.jpg', 'Sprinter Marathon', '2', '2022-10-01 12:32:27', '2022-10-01 12:32:27'),

Adding to the Momentum ETF that has been in existence for some time, are the Value and the Low Volatility versions – all three “risk premia” representing the most persistent and valuable risk premia in the South African equity market.\r\n\r\n“Equity premia” is derived from “equity risk premium” and we’ve used it because “premia” implies a positive return over and above the market over a long-term investment horizon.

Wits, along with Absa, are named Absa in the Indices that these ETFs track, representing their invaluable contribution in researching what risk premia present themselves in the South African market. This has been done by providing access to a unique database of South African equities going back to 2003, which accurately represents our market over time.\r\n\r\nb. AddYou is a start-up venture of five academics who were instrumental in the seeding of this idea, as well as consulting on and independently vetting the results.\r\n\r\nAbsa will continue to work with both entities, affirming our commitment to education/educations institutions and small business in SA.\r\n\r\n2. These are the first ETFs/Indices in SA that take cognisance of the concentrated market that the SA equity market actually is – it’s the first time an “equal risk contribution” methodology has been used in an ETF/Index. Essentially, an equal risk contribution methodology looks at the overall contribution of each stock against the volatility (risk) of the portfolio and ensures that the most volatile stocks have their weightings reduced and vice versa. This unique risk focused approach has shown to yield results.\r\n\r\nThe data to hand, from between January 2004  to 2018, shows that, not only does risk premia investing yield positive returns over a long period of time relative to the market, but also that by controlling for risk, we can improve returns or lessen the impact of market downturns.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n                      All Share   Momentum   Low Vol   Value\r\n\r\nAnnualised Return     16.27%     20.57%     19.49%    17.99%\r\n\r\nAnnualised Volatility 18.79%     16.90%     13.22%    16.58%\r\n\r\nMax Drawdown         -45.35%    -44.45%    -28.12%   -37.70%\r\n\r\nSharpe Ratio            0.87       1.22       1.47      1.08\r\n\r\nSource: Absa Corporate and Investment Bank\r\n\r\nThe Indices are calculated by S&P Dow Jones Indices, continuing Absa’s long-standing relationship with this international partner. “To have a global partner with rigorous controls ensuring and infrastructure is important in the Index/ETF space,” explains Anver Dollie, Head of Product Enablement, Absa NewFunds\r\n\r\n“Risk premia investing stems partly from the huge global growth in Index/ETF investing and provides investors (large pension funds all the way through to self-invested retail investors) with a new tool kit and approach to accessing rewarded risks in the market and Absa and its partners are proud to be leading the way in South African when it comes to this form of investing,” notes Ryan Sydow, Head of Distribution, Index and Structured Solutions, CIB.', 'https://www.absainvestmentmanagement.co.za/content/dam/wimi/investments/hero-images/product-pages/unit_trusts_subhero.jpg', 'Steven Nganga', '7', '2022-10-02 16:20:39', '2022-10-02 16:20:39'),

This is an important step for the South African economy, which aims to source reliable and cost-effective renewable energy to drive growth and employment.\r\n\r\nThis collaboration supports AREP’s objectives to utilise modern and renewable energy technologies to provide affordable electricity in South Africa and on the African continent. Absa is uniquely positioned given its key role in the African continent’s economy and its commitment to the development of renewable energy and the green economy. Absa is a leading funder in the renewable energy market and this transaction expands its participation in this important sector.\r\n\r\n“Renewables have been one of the most successful asset classes globally, offering a unique mix of attractive long-term, inflation-linked returns and growth providing significant scope to deploy further funds. African Rainbow Energy is engaging with other investors to increase its equity base and fund further growth with the aim of listing on the JSE in future,” said Brian Dames, African Rainbow Energy Chief Executive Officer. “African Rainbow Energy is uniquely positioned to access these investment opportunities given its track record for competence and delivery, its unique network of entrepreneurs and its partnership with entities that have a history of empowering women, youth, rural and urban communities.”\r\n\r\nAfrican Rainbow Energy will invest in renewable technologies including solar, wind, and battery energy storage solutions. It has already secured a deep investment pipeline and has partnered on a number of bids into Round 5 of South Africa’s highly successful REIPPP.\r\n\r\nAfrican Rainbow Energy will also invest in the private power sector and is working with several companies on bespoke energy solutions.\r\n\r\n“Our participation in African Rainbow Energy underscores Absa’s commitment to support renewable energy development and enhance the green economy, as part of our sustainability agenda,” said Jason Quinn, Absa interim Group Chief Executive. “Renewables are an important part of Absa’s sustainability strategy and we target financing or arranging more than R100 billion for environment, social and governance-related projects by 2025.”\r\n\r\nAbsa not only brings capital to the initiative but also expertise and experience in renewable energy financing. It is at the forefront of financing renewable energy in South Africa, having funded 33 projects to date, representing approximately 3 gigawatts, which amounts to 46% of the total projects closed to date in South Africa. Absa’s renewable energy loans amounted to R20 billion at 31 December 2020.\r\n\r\nDr. Patrice Motsepe said “approximately 15 years ago, we set out to create a world-class African energy company that would provide investors with predictable and growing returns from a clean energy portfolio of environmentally responsible assets. This energy company would also contribute to the growth of the South African economy and the economies on the rest of the African continent while improving the living conditions of the poor, unemployed and marginalised. Absa is a like-minded partner that shares our vision of building this initiative at scale in Africa.”\r\n\r\nAREP’s holding company, Ubuntu-Botho Energy Holdings Proprietary Limited, was founded by Dr. Patrice Motsepe and is the only African company that is a partner in the Breakthrough Energy Ventures which was started by Bill Gates and includes several globally respected leaders including Jeff Bezos, Richard Branson, Jack Ma, Mukesh Ambani and others. Breakthrough Energy Ventures is an investor-led fund that is building new, cutting-edge companies that aim to provide energy with zero emissions.\r\n\r\n“Our investment in African Rainbow Energy creates an opportunity for Absa to increase our role in the much-needed expansion of the renewable energy sector,” said Quinn.\r\n\r\n“The fund will provide investors with exposure to utility-scale, commercial and industrial sector clean-energy investments, building a platform of scale in South Africa, and will seek selected, bankable projects in Africa,” said Dames.\r\n\r\nThe effective date of the fund is subject to the fulfillment of certain conditions precedent, which are expected to be concluded in the fourth quarter of 2021.', 'https://i0.wp.com/bizwatchkenya.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/IMG_0008-2.jpg?fit=1620%2C1080&ssl=1', 'Benson Success', '4', '2022-10-06 16:36:23', '2022-10-06 16:36:23'),
